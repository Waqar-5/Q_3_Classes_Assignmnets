Guide to Effective AI Prompting

This is a simple guide to help you write better prompts for AI. Follow these steps:

Be Clear and Specific
Tell AI exactly what you want.
Example: Instead of “Write about dogs,” say: “Write a 300-word article about health benefits of dogs for mental and physical health, using a friendly tone.”

Use Action Words
Use words like Analyze, Compare, Create, Describe, Explain.
Example: “Compare the sizes and atmospheres of Earth, Mars, and Venus in a table.”

Show Examples
Give AI a sample output so it knows what you want.
Example: Task: Summarize this paragraph. Example output: { "summary": "..." }

Structure Your Prompts
Organize your prompt with:
Task: What to do
Context: Background info
Format: How answer should look
Example: Sample answer

Positive Instructions Work Better
Tell AI what to do, not just what NOT to do.
Example: Instead of “Don’t write too long,” say: “Write a short professional email summarizing meeting points.”

Control Output Format
If you want a special format, tell AI.
Example: Return as JSON: { "main_idea": "text", "supporting_points": ["point1","point2"] }

Use Variables for Reusability
Make prompts flexible using placeholders like {expertise}, {document_type}, {audience}.

Test and Improve
Keep track of what works, try different versions, and improve your prompts over time.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

Vague prompts → unclear answers. Be specific.

Conflicting instructions → confusing AI. Check your instructions.

Too many restrictions → limits creativity. Focus on positive instructions.

Ignoring limits → AI might stop mid-answer. Keep tasks small.

Not testing → first attempt is rarely perfect. Try variations.

Quick Examples

Social media post: “Write a short Instagram post for a new Pumpkin Spice Latte. Target: coffee lovers 25-40. Tone: warm. Include taste and aroma details.”

Customer feedback: Analyze reviews, give sentiment %, top positives and issues, recommendations.

Code: “Write Python function to sort list of dictionaries by key. Handle missing keys. Include example usage.”
